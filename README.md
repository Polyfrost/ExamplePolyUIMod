an example mod showing how to implement [PolyUI](https://github.com/Polyfrost/polyui-jvm) into a **modern** Minecraft environment.

**This should work for all versions 1.13+**, and it is currently implemented for 1.20.1-fabric. 
The default implementation depends on fabric-api-commands-v2 so the UI can be opened with the `/examplemod` command.
With some minor versioning tweaks, this can work in a full multiversion setup.
